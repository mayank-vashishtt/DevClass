// for the js , first you have to install nodejs in your system 
console.log("hello world"); 
// js can be run in browsers too 

// js is an interpreted language 
/*It seems like "Interpreted language" or "Interpreted lang." refers to a type of programming language that is
 executed line by line by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand. Examples of 
 interpreted languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.

JS is an single threaded language
A single-threaded language is a programming language that operates within a single thread of execution. 
In simpler terms, when a program written in a single-threaded language runs, it executes one operation at a time, 
in a sequential manner, from start to finish.


Js is a dynamic language
Dynamic languages are those where many of the features and checks are handled at runtime (when the program is executed) 
rather than at compile time.
 Variables in dynamic languages don't have a fixed type. You can assign a value of any type to a variable, 
 and the type can change during the execution of the program.
 Since types are determined at runtime, type-related errors are often caught only when the program is running
 Dynamic languages offer great flexibility and are often easier and faster to write because you don't have to define types explicitly.
 However, this flexibility can lead to runtime errors that are harder to catch.
 Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.


 what is static language?
 Static languages are those where most of the language features and type checks are performed at compile time, before the program is run.
 Variables in static languages have a fixed type that is determined at compile time and cannot change.
 Errors related to types are caught during the compilation process, reducing the chances of type-related runtime errors.
  Static languages are generally considered safer because they enforce type constraints early, leading to more predictable and reliable code.
  Java, C, C++, Rust, Go.



  ECMAScript 
  it is a scripting language in which js is based 
 serve as the guideline on the rules for scripting language design ES6, ES5
    ES6 is the latest version of ECMAScript, which was released in 2015. It introduced many new features and improvements to the language, 
    such as let and const for variable declarations, arrow functions, classes, and modules.
    ES5 is the previous version of ECMAScript, which was released in 2009. It is still widely used and supported by browsers and


js
it is a scripting lang that conforms to the ECMAScript specification 
js even have additional feature -- setinterval , fs, 



v8  - chrome open-source
spidermonkey  -- firefox
these are compiler which compile js code and should be changeed acc to latest ECMAScript updates
