-- andriod development   ---> ptr 2 


-- minimum 3 project  

-- GIT 
git uploading framework 

-- 1git init -- we have to do this only at a time of making a repo, do how much change no need to do this command 
-- git add .  --- you should do this command always , it is for adding files or updated files 
-- git commit -m "qwerty"  --- this is for giving the reference to your commit 
-- git branch -M main -- we have made this branch, of your repo have only one branch , then no need to make this command again and again
-- 1git remote add (http..... ) --- this even have to do only one time to make connection
-- git push / git push -u origin main 


- Homework -- what is command to push forcefully and what is meaning of this...  ?

html

- Homework -- what is DNS and DNS lookup ?
 --- how to give comments in HTML?


div -- one full width of a line , if more than that it will overflow  
span -- it will only take as much space as it needs , dont go to next line

- HW span doesn't work in flexbox, is it right if yes then why?

- HW what is diff between padding margin and border 
- HARD -- fork my repo and then through terminal add the ans below every question in the branch named Harsh
